      <p begin="0:00:01.60" end="0:00:03.08">I (heart) Matterhorn</p>
      <p begin="0:00:03.08" end="0:00:05.01">ADAM HOCHMAN, UC BERKELEY: I think the<br />engage tools, the tools that really allow</p>
      <p begin="0:00:05.01" end="0:00:12.01">you to interact and embrace the media is in<br />my mind what matters most, because that's</p>
      <p begin="0:00:12.01" end="0:00:16.56">when the learner starts taking ownership of<br />the material that's being presented to them</p>
      <p begin="0:00:16.56" end="0:00:20.36">ALLISON BLOODWORTH, UC BERKELEY: Seeing<br />how learners can use media in different and</p>
      <p begin="0:00:20.36" end="0:00:26.38">new ways, remixing media, annotating media,<br />doing collaborative editing, perhaps sharing</p>
      <p begin="0:00:26.38" end="0:00:31.03">the media with each other in new and exciting<br />ways is also really - it's kind of what Matterhorn</p>
      <p begin="0:00:31.03" end="0:00:33.46">is all about, making it better for learners</p>
      <p begin="0:00:33.46" end="0:00:38.67">JUDY STERN, UC BERKELEY: That's when the<br />use of webcasts and podcasts move beyond a</p>
      <p begin="0:00:38.67" end="0:00:44.78">passive couch potato experience into something<br />that's a real learning tool where students</p>
      <p begin="0:00:44.78" end="0:00:49.96">are interacting with the media and making<br />it meaningful to them</p>
      <p begin="0:00:49.96" end="0:00:53.69">MARKUS KETTERL, UNIVERSITY OF OSNABRUECK:<br />We can do much more with all this data we</p>
      <p begin="0:00:53.69" end="0:00:58.87">have that can be recorded out of the lecture<br />hall. We have slides, we have slide changes,</p>
      <p begin="0:00:58.87" end="0:01:05.53">we have students that interrupt during the<br />lecture, asking questions and getting answers.</p>
      <p begin="0:01:05.53" end="0:01:12.35">This is valuable information that needs to<br />be somewhere in user interfaces so later on,</p>
      <p begin="0:01:12.35" end="0:01:16.68">people can really work with the content and<br />it's not just a copy out of the lecture hall.</p>
      <p begin="0:01:16.68" end="0:01:22.42">It should be a real experience of what's happening<br />in the lecture hall. This is one of the major</p>
      <p begin="0:01:22.42" end="0:01:27.36">differences between, let's say, just a video<br />on YouTube and the engage application.</p>
      <p begin="0:01:27.36" end="0:01:33.40">OLAF SCHULTE, ETH ZURICH: We will have<br />a system that will navigate you to a point</p>
      <p begin="0:01:33.40" end="0:01:40.11">in time in the video. If we detected a certain<br />word on the slide, then you can search for</p>
      <p begin="0:01:40.11" end="0:01:46.46">that specific word, and jump into the video<br />right at the point where this word was on</p>
      <p begin="0:01:46.46" end="0:01:47.92">the slide.</p>
      <p begin="0:01:47.92" end="0:01:53.09">ALLISON: Thinking through what an administrator<br />might need, the different functionality and</p>
      <p begin="0:01:53.09" end="0:01:58.04">pages, the different ways of organizing that<br />information - that's fairly natural to me,</p>
      <p begin="0:01:58.04" end="0:02:00.25">so I love working on the administrative application.</p>
      <p begin="0:02:00.25" end="0:02:07.25">OLAF: I really hope for a very comfortable<br />and reliable scheduling system, because I</p>
      <p begin="0:02:08.50" end="0:02:15.50">think that's what administrators find helpful,<br />that towards the start of the semester they</p>
      <p begin="0:02:16.47" end="0:02:21.50">don't have all this work of scheduling each<br />class individually. But rather it should be</p>
      <p begin="0:02:21.50" end="0:02:28.44">integrated with other campus information systems.<br />So no scheduling or only a little scheduling</p>
      <p begin="0:02:28.44" end="0:02:30.81">is needed at the start of the semester</p>
      <p begin="0:02:30.81" end="0:02:33.66">CHRISTOPHER BROOKS, UNIVERSITY OF SASKATCHEWAN:<br />At the University of Saskatchewan we've got</p>
      <p begin="0:02:33.66" end="0:02:37.68">a number of classrooms that aren't your typical<br />room, they don't have just one VGA or one</p>
      <p begin="0:02:37.68" end="0:02:42.42">camera. We have audience cameras sometimes,<br />we have motion tracking cameras sometimes,</p>
      <p begin="0:02:42.42" end="0:02:47.46">and sometimes we have multiple VGA screens.<br />Finding a lecture capture system that works</p>
      <p begin="0:02:47.46" end="0:02:51.65">for this is really difficult, especially with<br />the commercial systems out there that aren't</p>
      <p begin="0:02:51.65" end="0:02:55.38">as flexible as soemthing like Matterhorn is.</p>
      <p begin="0:02:55.38" end="0:03:02.38">TOBIAS WUNDEN, ETH ZURICH: The one feature<br />that will blow people away once Matterhorn</p>
      <p begin="0:03:02.56" end="0:03:09.56">is out will be the media analyis. I'm very<br />sure that Matterhorn will be far ahead of</p>
      <p begin="0:03:11.18" end="0:03:17.32">any competitors that we might be having. The<br />media analysis is actually the future of lecture</p>
      <p begin="0:03:17.32" end="0:03:22.54">recording. This is what you get out of the<br />whole thing once you get it automated and</p>
      <p begin="0:03:22.54" end="0:03:22.95">scaled.</p>
      <p begin="0:03:22.95" end="0:03:27.20">JOSH HOLTZMAN, UC BERKELEY: One of the<br />things I'm really excited about Matterhorn</p>
      <p begin="0:03:27.20" end="0:03:32.77">is how modular the system is. So you can take<br />pieces of it, integrate with an existing lecture</p>
      <p begin="0:03:32.77" end="0:03:38.75">capture system. You can take the entire thing<br />and run it as a standalone, top to bottom,</p>
      <p begin="0:03:38.75" end="0:03:43.91">soup to nuts lecture capture system. You can<br />use it only if you need an encoding engine,</p>
      <p begin="0:03:43.91" end="0:03:49.14">you can use it for that. So that, I think<br />that's a really powerful piece of the software.</p>
