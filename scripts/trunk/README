README for Scripts

1) rc.local

	This script is added to a VM's /etc directory.  It checks whether matterhorn
	setup has already been run on the VM.  If it hasn't been run, it displayed a
	message asking the user to log in, otherwise it tells how the user can access
	the Matterhorn welcome page on this VM.
	
2) matterhorn_setup.sh

	This script is added to a VM's /etc/profile.d directory.  When a user logs in
	for the very first time, this script runs and installs 3rd party tools
	(including ffmpeg), as selected by the user via prompts.  Upon successful
	completion, the script moves itself into the /usr/local/matterhorn/bin directory.
	This script also modifies the motd.tail file to display instructions for accessing
	Matterhorn welcome page.
		
3) release.sh

	This script is meant for Release Manager (RM).  The JIRA_TKT variable must be
	changed to the Jira ticket related to a particular release.  Matterhorn version
	number variable must also be updated.  Since this script uses gpg to digitally
	sign the release file, it is intended to be run locally on the RM's computer,
	since the gpg private key resides on that computer.  This script exports Matterhorn
	from svn repo, builds, tar-zips the files and creates checksums.
