### MH-4493 Properties for Felix error watch process ###

# The following properties will define how to handle Felix is it does not stay
# running indefinitely. If, for whatever reason, Felix crashes it will not

# combination with crontab as a safeguard for Felix.

### Capture device definitions ###

# The following lines create three example inputs for the capture agent, often
# refered to as the "mock agent" for testing purposes.  Each input consists of:
# 1:  The source, in this case a file which is listed in the project pom.xml 
#     as a dependency. To use a real device instead you would put the linux 
#     device identifier on this line (eg:  /dev/my_capture_card).
# 2:  The output file name. This can be pretty much anything, though best
#     practice is to have the extension match the appropriate value for the
#     source/container format (e.g. .mpg if using mpegtsmux).
# 3:  The flavour of the input. This flavour must be defined from options given
#     in org.opencastproject.mediapackage.MediaPackageElements.  Known
#     good examples include:
#          presenter/source
#          presentation/source
#          audience/source
#          presentation/source
#          documents/source
#          indefinite/source
#
# To make a new input device available to the capture agent you must assign it
# a unique name (without whitespace or punctuation) that will show up in the
# administrative user interface.  For instance, the following lines will make a
# device called "audience_camera" available in the administrative interface:
#     capture.device.names=audience_camera
#     capture.device.audience_camera.src=/dev/video0
#     capture.device.audience_camera.outputfile=audience.mpg
#     capture.device.audience_camera.flavor=presentation/source
#
# Codecs, containers, and bitrates for devices can be specified as follows:
#     capture.device.audience_camera.codec=ffenc_mpeg2video
#     capture.device.audience_camera.codec.bitrate=2048
#     capture.device.audience_camera.container=mpegtsmux
# 
# Codecs must be  gstreamer encoders capable of accepting video/x-raw-yuv.  The
# codec bitrate is set relative to the encoder, because many encoders are written 
# by different people they do not agree on a standard format such as bps
# therefore you will have to determine what prefix the encoder uses. This can be
# done by executing "gst-inspect x264enc" and looking at what format the codec
# expects for its bitrate (in this case, kbit/sec).
#
# Known good codecs include:
#     MPEG2: "ffenc_mpeg2video" with values in bits/sec
#     H264: "x264enc" *does not use bitrate, see below
#     Ogg Theora: "theoraenc" with values in kilobits/sec
#     MP2 Audio: "twolame" with values in kilobits/sec
#     MP3: "lame" with values in kilobits/sec
#     Ogg Vorbis: "vorbisenc" with values in bits/sec
#
# *H.264 encoding works by using a constant quantizer instead of a constant
# bitrate. Therefore instead of using .bitrate use .quantizer:
# 		capture.device.audience_camera.codec=x264enc
#			capture.device.audience_camera.codec.quantizer=21
# 		capture.device.audience_camera.container=mp4mux
# The quantizer value for the x264enc element is a value from 1 - 50 (default: 21)
# and it determines how much data is to be removed from each frame when encoding. 
# Lower quantizer values will produce more detailed videos, but with larger file sizes.
#
# Known good containers include:
#     MPEG2 Transport Steam: "mpegtsmux"
#     MPEG4 Layer 2: "ffmux_mp4"
#     Ogg: "oggmux"
#     Quicktime: "ffmux_mov"
#
# All pipelines have buffers which store frames before encoding.  These buffers
# have a limit on the number of frames (called buffers by gstreamer), the number
# of bytes, and the length of time to store the information.  These parameters,
# when set incorrectly, can cause the output video to appear choppy.  To set these
# parameters the following keys have been defined with defaults for each input device:
#     capture.device.audience_camera.buffer.size=200
#     capture.device.audience_camera.buffer.bytes=10485760
#     capture.device.audience_camera.buffer.time=1000000000
#
# Keep in mind when setting these variables that increased settings can require
# more powerful hardware.
