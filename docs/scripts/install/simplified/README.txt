These scripts are meant for quickly install Matterhorn in a single machine. One-machine installations
are apt for testing and development purposes, but as a general rule should not be used in a production
environment.

If you want to do an installation across different machines (as recommended for production systems),
please use the 'official' scripts, or refer to the instructions for a manual installation included
in the Matterhorn wiki (http://opencast.jira.com/wiki).
