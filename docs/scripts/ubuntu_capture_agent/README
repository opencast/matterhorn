Capture Agent Installation
==========================

Execute install.sh to being installation process. You will need sudo privileges,
but do not run the script with the sudo command, you will be prompted where 
it is necessary. Running it with sudo will modify the environment in a bad way.

The script sets up a *new* user to control everything matterhorn related on the 
system. This user will be given sudo privileges because it needs to control many
devices that are owned by root as well as insert modules into the kernel.

At this point the project only supports using the Epiphan VGA2USB device for
capturing the screen, therefore the script must install the driver to use this.
It will try to locate the driver based on the kernel, but if there is no successful
match, either it was excluded from the script or it does not exist yet on the
Epiphan Linux driver download page http://www.epiphan.com/downloads/linux. If it
does not exist on the Epiphan download page then it can be requested by emailing
info@epiphan.com with your kernel information. 

The sources which APT uses is modified so that the machine has all that it 
requires right now for installing dependencies. To avoid conflicts it backs up
the original sources list and creates a new one. The necessary dependencies are
then installed from these sources using apt-get. These dependencies are:

  alsa-utils
  v4l-conf 
  ivtv-utils
  maven2 
  sun-java6-jdk
  subversion
  wget
  curl
  openssh-server
  gcc
  gstreamer0.10-ffmpeg
  gstreamer0.10-plugins-bad
  gstreamer0.10-plugins-good
  gstreamer0.10-plugins-bad-multiverse
  gstreamer0.10-plugins-ugly
  gstreamer0.10-plugins-base
  gstreamer0.10-plugins-ugly-multiverse
  gstreamer0.10-plugins-base-apps
  
Felix is downloaded from the Apache website and installed in the home directory
of the "matterhorn" user. 

In order to use the video4linux devices with Java libjv4linfo.so has to be
installed so that is downloaded from its homepage and installed using ant.

Once all of the dependencies have been installed the capture code from the 
Matterhorn codebase is checked out. This includes:

  matterhorn-build-tools
  matterhorn-runtime-tools
  matterhorn-metadata-api
  matterhorn-dublincore
  matterhorn-util
  matterhorn-media
  matterhorn-capture-admin-service-api
  matterhorn-capture-agent-api 
  matterhorn-capture-agent-impl
  
This code is then compiled and loaded into Felix by executing:

  mvn clean install -Pcapture -DdeployTo=${FELIX_HOME}/load
  
The script then sets up all of the devices it can recognize on your system using
a few v4l tools bundled with v4l-conf. It will then prompt for information 
regarding the devices (whether they are PAL/NTSC and the names that should be
used to identify them). After that it finishes creating the capture agent 
configuration by setting up the capture agent name, creating the directory
structure for capturing and prompting for the Matterhorn Core server to push
its status to.

After the script runs successfully, everytime the machine reboots the Matterhorn
Capture Agent will be executed. If it isn't, you can execute it manually by
running ${FELIX_HOME}/bin/start_matterhorn.sh as the "matterhorn" user. Also, the
logging information is available at ${FELIX_HOME}/logs.

Questions should go to the Matterhorn list (matterhorn@opencastproject.org)
