/**
 * Register a service implementing the <code>ServicePublication</code> interface
 * in order to publish metadata of a particular service (endpoint) via
 * Discovery. Metadata which has to be published is given in form of properties
 * at registration.
 * <p>
 * In order to update published service metadata, update the properties
 * registered with the <code>ServicePublication</code> service. Depending on
 * Discovery's implementation and underlying protocol it may result in an update
 * or new re-publication of the service.
 * <p>
 * In order to unpublish the previously published service metadata, unregister
 * the <code>ServicePublication</code> service.
 * <p>
 * Please note that providing the {@link #SERVICE_INTERFACE_NAME} property is
 * mandatory when a <code>ServicePublication</code> service is registered. Note
 * also that a Discovery implementation may require provision of additional
 * properties, e.g. some of the standard properties defined below, or may make
 * special use of them in case they are provided. For example an SLP-based
 * Discovery might use the value provided with the {@link #ENDPOINT_LOCATION}
 * property for construction of a SLP-URL used to publish the service.
 * <p>
 * Also important is that it's not guaranteed that after registering a
 * <code>ServicePublication</code> object its service metadata is actually
 * published. Beside the fact that at least one Discovery service has to be
 * present, the provided properties have to be valid, e.g. shouldn't contain
 * case variants of the same key name, and the actual publication via Discovery
 * mechanisms has to succeed.
